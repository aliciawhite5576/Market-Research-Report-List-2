<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The EMV Smart Cards Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Form</li><li>Contactless Form</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>EMV smart cards are classified into two main types: contact form and contactless form. Contact form smart cards require physical contact with a card reader or terminal for data transfer and authentication. These cards are inserted into a reader, allowing the cardholder to input their personal identification number (PIN) for verification.
