<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Grounding Busbar Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Segregated Bus Duct</li><li>Nonsegregated Bus Duct</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Grounding Busbar market consists of two types: Segregated Bus Duct and Nonsegregated Bus Duct. Segregated Bus Duct is a type of electrical power supply system that uses separate conductors for different phases, resulting in higher safety and reliability. Nonsegregated Bus Duct, on the other hand, employs a common enclosure for all phases, which can lead to potential safety hazards. Both types contribute to efficient power distribution in industrial and commercial settings, but Segregated Bus Duct is considered more advantageous due to its superior safety features.</p></p>
