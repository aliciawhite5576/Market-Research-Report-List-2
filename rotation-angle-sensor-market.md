<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rotation Angle Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Brushless Sensor</li><li>Brushed Sensor</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The rotation angle sensor market consists of two main types: brushless sensors and brushed sensors. Brushless sensors utilize non-contact methods such as Hall Effect or optical sensors to determine the rotation angle of an object. These sensors are commonly used in applications that require high precision and reliability. On the other hand, brushed sensors use physical brushes to establish contact with the rotating object to measure the angle. These sensors are often found in simpler and less critical applications where cost is a significant factor.</p></p>
