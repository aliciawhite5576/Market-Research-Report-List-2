<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Silicon Carbide Schottky Diodes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>SMD</li><li>Through Hole</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Silicon Carbide Schottky Diodes are available in two main types: SMD (surface-mount device) and Through Hole. SMD diodes are small electronic components that can be directly mounted onto a PCB (printed circuit board) without the need for holes or leads. They are widely used in compact electronic devices where space is limited. On the other hand, Through Hole diodes have leads that are inserted into pre-drilled holes on a PCB, providing a more secure and reliable connection. These diodes are commonly used in industrial equipment or applications that require higher power handling capabilities.</p></p>
